# HTML5 Boiler Plate

This is a truly basic HTML 5 boiler plate that offers a very basic starting point for any website project. The base stylesheet only contains browser reset rules to override the browser's internal stylesheets and the included JavaScript file is blank.

### HTML Files
The index.html and addtionalpage.html are identical files include all the starting tags you need, and they properly validate as HTML 5 as well. The files also include a mobile friendly meta tag and links to the following directories mentioned below.

- index.html should automatically be recognized by your web server as the home page.

- additional.html is simply an extra file you can rename and/or save as to use for additional webpages without accidentally overwriting the index file.

### CSS and JavaScript Files

- CSS directory contains two style sheets:

    - **styles.css** file is for all the main CSS rules that will apply to your site. The file begins with Eric Meyer's browser reset styles. Any styles you want to add to your website should begin after the reset styles section. **Note:** There is a comment after it that says where to begin adding your rules.

    - **print.css** file is for optimizing your webpages for printing. Note: All style rules in this file will only apply to printouts. To see how your webpage will look when printed out on paper, you can choose print preview in your browser. 

- JS directory contains a blank **scripts.js** file that can be used for any Javascript code. Any addtional JavaScript files should go in this directory.

**Note:** The script tag in the html files should remain at the bottom of all your HTML documents, just above the closing the body tag.

***Note about images***
Due to Git not including empty directories by default and the fact that you might have a specific method for storing images, there is no images directory included in this boilerplate.

**Note about the license.md and readme.md files**
The license and readme.md files are included in this repository simply for informational purposes. They DO NOT need to be included in any of your website projects.
